        The goal of this study is to rate the quality of explanations provided for the decision of a unknown model classifing images.
        <br> <br>
        For each example, you will be presented with an image, the model's predicted class and <i>four</i> explanations for the model's prediction, each extracted with a different method.
        Each explanation consists of an heatmap with the same size as the image, where the color around each pixel indicating the <i>impact</i> of the pixel for the model's prediction. 
        <span style="color:blue;">blue values</span> indicate the a pixel contributed positively to the model's prediction, while <span style="color:red;">red values</span> indicate the a pixel contributed negatively to the model's prediction. White values indicate close to no contribution.
        <br> <br>
        You will be asked to <i>rank</i> the quality of the four different explanation for each image, according to how much you <i>align</i> the explanation to represent relative importance of the pixels for the model's prediction. 
        For example, if an explanation highlights the same area of the image that you would say you would highlight to say an image is of a cat, you would say that explanation is better
        Please use numerical rankings, from 1 to 4, where 1 and 4 means that the explanation aligns the most and least, respectively, with how you would justify the prediction of the model. 
        Ties are allows ("1, 1, 3, 4" is a valid ranking).
